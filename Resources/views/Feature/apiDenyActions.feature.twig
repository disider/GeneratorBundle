    Given there is a payload:
    """
    {}
    """
    When I request "<method> <route>"
    Then the response status code should be 403
    Examples:
        | method | route                |
        | GET    | /api/{{ entity_path }}   |
        | POST   | /api/{{ entity_path }}   |
        | GET    | /api/{{ entity_path }}/0 |
        | PUT    | /api/{{ entity_path }}/0 |
